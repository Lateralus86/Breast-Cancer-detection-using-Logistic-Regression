Repository: Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression

Introduction:
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving the prognosis of breast cancer patients. This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression for breast cancer detection. The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which consists of features extracted from breast cancer patients' digitized images.

Installation:
To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nameless-86/Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression.git
Dependencies: This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Install the dependencies using the following command:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Dataset: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is included in the repository as "breast_cancer.csv". You can also download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
Usage:
Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can run the logistic_regression.py script to train and test the logistic regression model. The script performs the following steps:

Data loading: Loads the breast cancer dataset using Pandas.
Data preprocessing: Performs data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model training: Implements logistic regression using Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class and fits the model to the training data.
Model evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on the test data.
Model prediction: Predicts the breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) for new data samples using the trained logistic regression model.
Contributing:
If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Please follow the standard GitHub workflow for contributing to open-source projects.
